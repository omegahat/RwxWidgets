<h1>FAQ for RwxWidgets Package</h1>

<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> I'm running on Mac OS X using the console, and I can create
  windows, but they are always in the background and don't respond to
  events. I basically get the spinning beachball.
  What's the problem?
      
 <dd>
     Use Simon Urbanek's CarbonEL package.
     And make certain you are using a Carbon application
      in which you launch R, e.g. Terminal, iTerm, AquaEmacs, 
     and specifically not an X11 xterm. This does not work in an xterm.
<p/>
     The following  works well.
<pre>
library(RwxWidgets)
wxInit()
library(CarbonEL)     
</pre>     
     <p>
     If you run R via the "standard" GUI
     in the R dmg file, the RwxWidgets tools will work just fine.
     You can run one of the scripts and enter the event loop.
     Then, when you close that window by deleting it with the red
     X button on the frame, you will get the prompt back.
     It is not ideal, but it does allow us to test RwxWidgets.


 <dt>
 <li> I am trying to install wxWidgets on my Mac. I run configure and
 all seems well and then when I type make, I get an error immediately
     about the compiler not understanding -fpascal-strings and
 -no-cpp-precomp.
      What's up?
 <dd>

       Copy the files /usr/share/libtool/config.sub and
       /usr/share/libtool/config.guess into the top-level wxWidgets
        source directory and then re-run  configure and things should
       be better.

<p/>
      If this doesn't fix things, edit configure.in and find the line
      that sets the FLAGS to "-fpascal-strings".
      Simply comment this out or remove set the contents to "" rather
     than "-fpascal-strings". Then, back at the shell, run
      autoconf and then ./configure  and things should be okay.

<p>
 Alternatively, you can run
     configure with the following arguments
     --disable-shared --enable-unicode --enable-monolithic
     
 <dt>
 <li>  I am working on Linux and when I bring up an HTML document using the
   wxHTML widget, I get an error dialog about the encoding. How can I get rid of these?
 <dd>  Configure the  wxWidgets build with --enable-unicode,
        untar the source and run the command
<pre>
        ./configure --enable-unicode ; make
</pre>
   from within the top-level directory of the wxWidgets source tree.    


  <dt>
  <li> When I try to run RwxWidgets within a debugger, I get problems
starting the R process or loading the package.
  <dd>
    It is probably best to compile wxWidgets without support for threads.
  Do this with
<pre>
        ./configure --enable-threads=no --enable-joystick=no ; make
</pre>


  <dt>
  <li> I have a method for handling HTML links using the OnLinkClicked
      method for wxHtmlWindow.
      But when the method gets called, I can't use the wxHtmlLinkInfo
      object as expected, e.g. <code>link$GetHref()</code> doesn't work.
      What's the problem?
      
  <dd> The issue is that wxHtmlLinkInfo is not a dynamic class,
      i.e. we cannot ask the C++ instance about its class information.
      This is an implementation choice for wxWidgets and leaves us
      without the ability to dynamically determine the class of
      the object and so find its methods implicitly via $.
      Rather, you have to call the methods explicitly, e.g.
      <code>wxHtmlLinkInfo_GetHref(info)</code>
      or
      <code>as(info, "wxHtmlLinkInfo")$GetHref()</code>.
      If you are going to make repeated use of the object,
      then doing the coercion and assigning the result
      to a variable in R and then calling the methods
      may be convenient, e.g.
      <pre>
       info = as(info, "wxHtmlLinkInfo")
       info$GetHref()
      </pre>


  <dt>
  <li> When writing code, I use R_make_wxWidget_Ref() and I get an
      error about the first argument not being a wxObject *
      eventhough it is an instance of a class that does extend
      wxObject.
      What's up?
      
  <dd> Make certain you have included the header file that defines
      that class. Otherwise you may just be getting a simple
      declaration for the class, e.g. friend class Foo
      and so the inheritance is not known to the compiler at that
      point.
      For example, in RwxHtmlParser.cpp, we had to include
      wx/html/htmlwin.h
      to get the definition of wxHtmlWindow.

      I am trying to install on the Mac from source.
      When I run configure and the type make I get an error about a
      compiler flag -no-cpp-precomp. What's the problem?
      
  <dd>
       Copy config.* from /usr/share/libtool/ to the top-level
      directory of the

  <dt>
  <li> How do I build wxWidgets on Windows?
  <dd> Download the source and untar it or expand it by running the
  .exe if it is a self-installing version.
       Then go to the directory that was created and create a new sub-directory, say,
       "duncan". Then 'cd' to it.
       Then type ../configure --enable-threads=no --enable-joystick=no --enable-unicode
