The wxBitmap  constructor using the file name and image type 
   (const wxString &, long)
needs to be const (wxString &, wxBitmapType) or else we end up
with a call to the wrong constructor. There is something with the 
compiler missing this.
And sure enough, if we change the definition to long and not wxBitmapType
in wx/gtk/bitmap.h, then the compiler gives an error saying that there
is ambiguity eventhough it knows what to do.

But we can get this type from the TU file. It is the documentation that is wrong.




For version 2.8.4, we had to

 RwxColour, RwxWindow, RwxTreeCtrl
     use a const for variables that might be assigned on of the builtin colours
 RwxFileDialog_class, testFileDialog
   The wxFileDialog::OnOk method is no longer present.
    (Was this actually being invoked by wxWidgets when the event occurred.)

 The event handling mechanism doesn't work.
   The event identifiers are not the same across versions.
 
 The enums, etc. probably need to be regenerated.

Done July 11.  See r:frag id="globals" in run.xml.

 Windows don't appear automatically without a push from wxEventLoop()$Run.
 Needed to add a call to gdk_flush. We'll see what happens on CarbonEL

<note>
Generally (for both versions)

Compiler is not picking up differences between
  type *x
and
  type &x

and allowing us to pass the pointer value through.
