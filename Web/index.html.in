</p>

The RwxWidgets package provides an R-language interface to the <a
href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">wxWidgets GUI toolkit</a>.  This
allows users of R to create GUIs using this toolkit and to specify R
functions as callbacks for the different events that users can
generate.  The wxWidgets toolkit is a cross-platform, native toolkit
in that it can be used on all major platforms and uses the native
look-and-feel of each of those platforms.
<p/>

wxWidgets provides the usual set of widgets (or interface components)
such as buttons, menus, radio buttons, dialogs, sliders,
etc. Additionally, it provides higher-level components such as an HTML
display widget, a (data) grid similar to a spreadsheet table layout of
cells, and so on.  The HTML widget is quite customizable (like the
gtkHTML widget) in that allows us to provide customized tag handlers,
dynamically embed arbitrary widgets within the document display,
control image and document download, all within R.

<p>

The current state of the interface is a manually generated collection
of R functions and associated C++ routines dynamically loaded into R
that provide access
<ul>
  <li> to creating instances of wxWidgets objects,
  <li> to dynamically connecting and disconnecting event handlers or
     callbacks
  <li> add R functions as tag handlers for HTML  documents,
  <li>  embed widgets within an HTML document.
      
</ul>

This current interface is merely a proof of concept of important
aspects of the wxWidgets facilities.  To complete this interface, we
seek a mechanism to automate the bindings to the other classes and
their methods.  Our approach is to develop and use the <a
href="http://www.omegahat.org/RGCCTranslationUnit/">RGCCTranslationUnit
package</a> to do this.  This allows us to read C/C++ code into R via
an intermediate representation and then generate interfaces to the
data structures, classes and routines defined in that code.

<p> We hope to have the initial version of this interface completed in
the next few weeks.  We have a functioning R graphics device that uses
wxWidgets and this allows us to embed a graphics device within
wxWidgets GUI, including within scrolled windows, notebooks, HTML
documents, etc.  This is available from <a
href="../RwxDevice">RwxDevice</a> and is similar in spirit to the <a
href="http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Descriptions/gtkDevice.html">gtkDevice</a>
package.
