<dt class="question">
For C++ routines that return actual objects and not pointers to an
object, how do we convert the result to an R value?
</dt>
<dd class="answer">
If we are dealing with a simple structure with no (real) methods (it
might have methods for special operators or constructors and
destructors) then we can copy the value field by field to an R list,
or an R instance of a class with the corresponding slots.

<p></p>
If we are dealing with a more interesting object with actual methods,
then it is not clear that copying the fields is the right
approach. For one, we may omit private and protected fields.  Also,
the object is the combination of the data and the methods and a copy
of the data in R is not necessarily meaningful.
<p></p>
As a result, we attempt to create a new copy of this object
on the heap and return a reference to that.

<p></p>
If there is a method in the C++ class that
takes a single argument which is an instance of
that class, we call that.

<dt class="question">
Some C++ classes have methods with exactly the same name and
signature. The only difference is that one has the const keyword
at the end. For example, the Inflate methods in wxRect.h 
in the gdicmn.h file of the wxWidgets include directory is one.
What can we do about this?
</dt>
<dd class="answer">
Unfortunately, the translation unit doesn't seem to make
information about this available in the 
different nodes describing these routines.

<p></p>
At its simplest, we can discard the duplicated
symbols after we have generated the bindings.
