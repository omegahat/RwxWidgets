Let's take a look at the wxGrid class

This is defined in wx/grid.h which actually points
to wx/generic/grid.h

The define's in this file are hard for us to deal with
at the compiler level as the pre-processor has expanded them.

Let's lookat grid.cpp.tu.

There are several classes defined in that file.


wxGridTableBase


Start with the top-level node and follow the 'dcls' field.
Walk the linked list via the 'chan' field of each,
looking at the 'srcp' field.


Let's look at node @3158

type_decl  artificial
 (@3158)




The idea is that we can extend this class using
the name, say, R_wxGridTableBase.

For each field or method in the public
section of the base class definition
(wxGridTableBase), we have a
corresponding field in the derived class
(R_wxGridTableBase) which is
of type SEXP.
For methods in the base class, this 
contains an R function.

* Only provide these for the virtual methods.

These R functions that act as methods in the

Polymorphic Overloaded functions.


Need to be able to invoke the inherited method from within R.
e.g. from within the overriding derived method.


Want to have access to both original and derived class
methods. 


References GetValueAsCustom(const wxString & typeName)


These take ownership of the pointer.
SetAttr(wxGridCellAttr *)



Add facilities to treat the grid as a two dimensional table.
