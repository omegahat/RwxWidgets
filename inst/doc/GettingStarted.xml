One of the first things I wanted to know was how do I arrange
a collection of widgets in a frame as a row, or in a table.
Looking through the documentation, there is no 
layout widget as there is in Gtk. However, there are 
wxSizer classes which give a lot of flexibility
and perhaps more than the other toolkits.
