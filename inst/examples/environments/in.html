Note the CDATA to protect the &lt;&lt;-
The CDATA is not stripped away by the parser
or handled specially except for to escape the characters.
So the GetContent() call returns the CDATA markers
but now there is a parameter for removing it (very simple-minded
however, but will work in most practical cases)

<init>
<![CDATA[
choices <<- c('Normal','Exponential','Uniform','Beta')
curDist <<- "Normal"
]]>
</init>


Note that I have enclosed the code within { }.
And one might also put ; at the end of each expression.
We used to have to do this for SNetscape. This HTML and R parser
interaction doesn't seem to require it.

<p>
It is not obvious we need the attribute choices here
and so it is just confusing. An attribute name being
the same as its value and the same as the R variable
name leads to great ambiguity.  And in fact, 
the reference in the code to the choices variable
will find the variable defined above assuming we have the
correct environment for the evaluation.

<p>
Lastly, where is distDevice ever defined?
<listbox  choices="choices">
   curDist = choices[ listbox_value ] 
   showDist(curDist, whichDev = distDevice)
</listbox>

<p>
<Rdevice name="distDevice">
    showDist(curDist, whichDev = NULL)
</Rdevice>
